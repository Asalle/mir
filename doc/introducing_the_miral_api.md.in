Introducing the Miral API
=========================

The main() program
------------------

The main() program from miral-shell looks like this:

```{include} @CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR@/examples/shell_main.cpp
```

This shell is providing FloatingWindowManagerPolicy, TilingWindowManagerPolicy
and SpinnerSplash. The rest is from MirAL.

If you look for the corresponding code in lp:qtmir and lp:mir youâ€™ll find it
less clear, more verbose and scattered over multiple files.

A shell has to provide a window management policy (miral-shell provides two:
FloatingWindowManagerPolicy and TilingWindowManagerPolicy). A window management
policy needs to implement the [miral::WindowManagementPolicy](api/classmiral_1_1_window_management_policy) interface for
handling a set of window management events.

The way these events are handled determines the behaviour of the shell.

The [miral::WindowManagerTools](api/classmiral_1_1_window_manager_tools) interface provides the principle methods for
a window management policy to control Mir.
