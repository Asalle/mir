# Welcome to Mir {#mainpage}

**Mir** is set of libraries for building Wayland based shells. Mir
simplifies the complexity that shell authors need to deal with: it
provides a stable, well tested and performant platform with touch,
mouse and tablet input, multi-display capability and secure
client-server communications.

Mir deals with the bringup and configuration of a broad array of
graphics and input hardware, abstracts hardware differences away
from shell authors (transparently dealing with hardware quirks) and
integrates with system components such as greeters.

Window management is integrated into Mir with useful default behaviour
and is extremely customisable by shell authors using a simple high-level
API.
