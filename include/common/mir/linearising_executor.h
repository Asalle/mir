 *      A() happens-before B(). That is, the entire execution of A is completed before B is started.
 * 2.   No work is performed concurrently. For any two calls linearising_executor.spawn(A)
 *      linearising_executor.spawn(B) either A() happens-before B() or B() happens-before A().
 * 3.   Work is deferred; linearising_executor.spawn(A) will not block on the execution of A
